2. Set up the current year structure
3. Create the STATIC folder
4. Move existing documents to appropriate folders

### 2. Naming Conventions
- Use the provided numbering system (01, 02, etc.)
- Keep folder names clear and consistent
- Use hyphens (-) to separate words
- Avoid special characters in folder names

### 3. Organization Rules
- Always check if a document belongs in year-based or STATIC folders
- Regularly review and archive old documents
- Maintain consistent structure across years
- Keep folder hierarchy no deeper than 4 levels

### 4. Best Practices

- Archive completed projects promptly
- Maintain backup copies of critical folders
- Document any custom folders you add to the structure

## Regular Maintenance
